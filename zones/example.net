#
#  In this example the records are "unqualified", which means they're
# missing the name of the zone.  This is in contrast to the fully-qualified
# records you'll find in "example.com".
#
#  In this case you can copy this file to multiple zones to have identical
# records with no confusion.
#
#

#
#  The general form of the input is ":" deliminated records:
#
#   TYPE : NAME : VALUE : TTL
#
#  Where type is:
#
#   @ for MX.
#   + for A.
#   6 for AAAA.
#   C for CNAME.
#   T for TXT.


#
# MX record - route all incoming email for the domain "example.net"
# to the host `mail.example.net`.
#
# NOTE we define mail-priority here, rather than TTL.
#
@:mail.example.net:15

#
# Although TTL can be added:
#
#    @example.net:mail.example.net:15:300
#
# All record types allow TTL to be added as the last-field.
#


#
#  IPv4 records for the website
#
+:80.68.84.103:300
+www:80.68.84.103:300

#
#  IPv6 records for the website - note the lack of ":" in the address.
#
6:200141c8010b01030000000000000010:300
6www:200141c8010b01030000000000000010:300

#
# Now we define the address of `mail.example.net` which is
# listed in the MX-record, and is the host to which mail will
# be sent
#
+mail:127.0.0.1:300

#
# A TXT record - NOTE That the value must be quoted.
#
Texample:"v=spf1 mx a ptr ip4:1.2.3.4 ?all":300
